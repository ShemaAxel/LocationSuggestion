===============================
Location Suggestion API
===============================

Used Node JS and the Express library

Used mLab(Mongo) to implement my own repository containing a list of places (name,lat,long)

Used Jasmine js to implement API tests

Also in addition I did add logging as extra since logs are crucial to an application

================================

=> RUN the index.js to start the application or just type nodemon in the project root dirctory
NB: View the console to see which port the application is running on

=> RUNNING test: npm test

=> You can test the API using POSTMAN or any other tool

===============================
What's not done?

Score calculation based on latitude and longitude is not complete for now.
